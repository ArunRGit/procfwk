## NUnit

A C# NUnit project is used within the progressing framework solution to perform integration testing against the grandparent and parent pipelines. This supports a range of different framework capabilitites and scenario's.

The primary goal of this NUnit project is to ensure each quality for each release of the processing framework code project. However, the testing approach could be taken and applied to other Data Factory instances using the testing helpers classes as a foundation.
